📌 Project Title

Design and Implementation of a GUI-Based Key Stroke Logging System in Python

📄 Project Description

This project is an educational Python desktop application that demonstrates how keyboard events such as key press and key release can be captured and processed in real time. It provides a simple graphical interface built using Tkinter, allowing the user to control when logging starts and stops.

The system records keystrokes with timestamps and stores them in both human-readable text format and structured JSON format. This project is intended strictly for learning purposes to understand event-driven programming, GUI development, and file handling concepts in Python.

✨ Features

GUI interface using Tkinter

Start and Stop logging functionality

Real-time keyboard event capture

Timestamped key press and release records

Logs stored in:
